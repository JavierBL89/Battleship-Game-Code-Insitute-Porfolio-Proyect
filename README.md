# Overview

This is a very simple computized version of the very popular Battleship game board launched in 1931, see ![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

The game is only run into the terminal and utilises the Code Institue template which makes possible to run the game in the browser.

## How to play

* The number of ships is standard, and the ships will be placed randomly.
* The user must enter row and column as a shot target.
* The radar will show one of the above symbols in response to the user's guess.
* Coputer guesses will also be displayed.
* The game will finish when one of the players gets to shink all of the opponent's boats.

## Planing stage

## Target audience

 Anyone looking for a strategy game to have fun on their own for a little while, by it at home, bus, metro, etc, since it is playable on any device.

 ## User stories

 - As a user i want a clear and straightforward game instructions.

 - As a user i want an easy and simple online game to start and finish it quickly.

 - As a user a want it to be challenging.

 - As a user i want it to be visually attractive.

## Flow Chart

This is a simple flow chart of the game flow to scheme the steps needed to develop it

I used free app ![draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

## Features

At this point the game is limited in features due to its simplicity. 

 - Size: 

The game board size is set to 8x8, with no chance for the user to pick at their choice.

 - Ships:

 At this point the number of ships for every player is also set to 5, being these of a single cell length.

 - Shots:

 The user is allow to take their guess manually.

 ## Future features

 Many features could added to improve the user's experience:

 * Let user pick board size
 * Let the user position boats on their board
 * Let user pick game difficulty by reducing the number of boats or/and implementing a limited number of shots available, also by limitating the time avaiblable to finish the game.
 * Add visual experience with a nice interface
 * Make it multiplayer

 ## Testing

 - Manual testing

 When developing i used manual testing by printing out the code so very often to check whether if it was working as wanted. 

 - VS Debugger

 I used a extension of Visual Studio named Jupiter, which i still don't know how to use it...
 The debugger tool tells you all the error while coding like extra whitespaces, code lines way to long.
 It also allows you to debugg using breakpoints, which i still don't understand, sometimes it shows an error but the terminal runs perfectly...
